// A Memory_Context tracks three kinds of Memory_Blocks: buffers, free blocks and used blocks.
// Buffers are the backing memory. They track the allocations the context makes from its parent.
// Every byte in a context's buffers is also tracked in either a free block or a used block
// depending on whether the byte is allocated. Free blocks are sorted by size so we can quickly find
// a best fit. Used blocks are sorted by address for speedy deallocation. On deallocation, a newly
// freed block coalesces with contiguous free blocks.
//
// The `sentinel` flag only appears in the used blocks array. Sentinels are blocks of one byte
// marking the first and last byte in each backing buffer. They help with deallocation because they
// let us infer the size of the free blocks "missing" from the used blocks array (otherwise we
// wouldn't know whether gaps between neighbouring used blocks occur because there's a free block in
// between or because the used blocks are in different buffers). Sentinels behave like used blocks
// except that everything will probably break if you try to deallocate one.
//
// One day we want to stop reserving any bytes for the sentinel blocks. Ideally we could also remove
// the `sentinel` flag. Maybe the sentinels could be zero-sized. But we could no longer rely on the
// assumption that no two used blocks have the same address. However this would improve memory
// fragmentation. @Speed @Memory
