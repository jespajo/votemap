Figure out URL path structure
    bounds
    zoom level
    layer identifier

Figure out how many zoom levels you want to have e.g.
    zoom level 0    320 px = 4000 km
                      1 px = 12.5 km
    zoom level 1      1 px =  6.3 km
    zoom level 2      1 px =  3.1 km
    zoom level 3      1 px =  1.6 km
    zoom level 4      1 px =  780 m
    zoom level 5      1 px =  390 m
    etc.

Get main() to call a function that returns different verts depending on bounds, zoom level and layer.

Get JavaScript just to request based on the current zoom level when you press a key.

Turn main() into a CGI script that parses this and returns the verts to the web browser.
