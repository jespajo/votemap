# Lines starting with # are comments.
# Two (or more) newlines indicate the start of a new block.
# The first line of each block is a regex to be compiled. It is sandwiched by '/' chars.
# Subsequent lines in the block are strings to be tested against the compiled regex.
# We don't include the expected output in this file; instead we test our output against that of another regex implementation.
